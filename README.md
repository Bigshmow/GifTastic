# GifTastic
week-06-ajax/Homework
This is the GifTastic homework for UCSD Coding BootCamp.

The project can create gifs at the touch of a button as well as pause and play the gif that was generated by clicking the image.

If you'd like to add your own buttons just type a search term or phrase in the search bar, hit submit, and have fun!

The goal of this project was to demonstrate working knowledge of AJAX and further expand on click listeners specifically elements created through user input.
